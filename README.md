In this second seminar we are going to divide the main script in 4 different exercises.

# Exercise 1
Reusing out BBB shorted video from the previous lab and create a python script that will output a video that will show the macroblocks and the motion vectors.

# Exercise 2
Creating a script in order to create a new BBB container. 
1. Cutting BBB video into 1 minute video (For it, we will need the original bbb.mp4 video that lasts 9 minutes but Github does not let me upload it and it is too large).
2. Exporting the BBB 1 minute video as a mp3 stereo track.
3. Exporting the BBB 1 minute audio in AAC.
4. Packaging everything in a mp4 file.

# Exercise 3
Creating a script which reads the tracks from an MP4 container, and itâ€™s able to say which broadcasting standard would fit.

DISCLAIMER: I was not able to do this exercise as I did not have the time to understand it as well as I would like to.

# Exercise 4
Once having download the Spider-Man subtitles in the https://www.opensubtitles.org/es/subtitles/7301884/spider-man-homecoming-es web, integrating them in a video and output the printed subtitles.
